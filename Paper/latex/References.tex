\begin{appendix}
You can use an appendix for optional proofs or details of your evaluation which are not absolutely necessary to the core understanding of your paper. 

\section{Final Thoughts on Good Layout}
Please use readable font sizes in the figures and graphs. Avoid tempering with the correct border values, and the spacing (and format) of both text and captions of the PVLDB format (e.g. captions are bold).

At the end, please check for an overall pleasant layout, e.g. by ensuring a readable and logical positioning of any floating figures and tables. Please also check for any line overflows, which are only allowed in extraordinary circumstances (such as wide formulas or URLs where a line wrap would be counterintuitive).

Use the \texttt{balance} package together with a \texttt{\char'134 balance} command at the end of your document to ensure that the last page has balanced (i.e. same length) columns.
